- A* path finding feature
    - start block (only one allowed)
    - end block (only one allowed)
    - search block
    - path block

    - after placing start and end block, we can allow user to press "start A* algo" button
    - when the algo is running, we cannot allow user to remove any block
    - after algorithm, user needs to clear the whole path before manipulating other blocks  -> need a clear button
    
    - if start and end block exist -> A* button show
    - if path generated done -> A* button gone -> clearn button show
